### Initial Deployment on Firebase

Built this app using Angular, with Github serving as a Database for all the contents you see here.

Since, its the first iteration, many routes aren't added yet.
LOL, I hardly slept today!

### Milestones:
- Pretty good UI on desktop
- Created Repository `daily-progress` on github
- Created Static JSONs that contains `cron@daily` and `posts` objects
