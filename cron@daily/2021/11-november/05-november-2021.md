### LeetCode Problem Solving

This is the first daily challenge problem, that I've solved in LeetCode.  

Pretty easy and fun(atleast for me), `math` stuff.
Yet, this is not the most optimal solution for this problem.  

The solution I came up with has a linear time complexity, whereas this problem has logarithmic and constant time solutions as well.
