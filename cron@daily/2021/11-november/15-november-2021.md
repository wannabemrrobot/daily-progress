### Got Offer From Zoho
Today, I got an offer from Zoho Corporation as a `Member Technical Staff(Software Developer)`.

`"I gave it a try just to get an insight about the coding assessment, but it turned out to be a good time rolled for me!"`

#### Gratitude
Special Thanks to my pals, for being and also not being there during crucial times ;)
