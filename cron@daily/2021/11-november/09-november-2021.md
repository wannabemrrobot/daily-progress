### LeetCode Problem Solving
This is my first hard problem in leetcode. At first, the problem seemed pretty easy, as it only requires us to iterate through arrays, and perform some string operations on the array elements. I did solved it using the bruteforce method, but the catch here is I got `Time Limit Exceeded`.  
I was never suprised. Infact, it was what I expected it to be. I tried reading the solution from the leetcode team. But, I never really understood that. It basically requires data structures like `Trie`. So, added it in the Todo List.  
Will try to solve it again, after learning advanced data structures.
