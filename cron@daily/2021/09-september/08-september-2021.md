### Stack & Big O

Well, knowing how to analyse the complexities of an algorithm helps one to better understand the efficiencies of his algorithms.

`Stack` - Implemented a basic data structure on top of Arrays.

#### Outcomes: 
- Vanilla implementation of Stack in Java
- Used this Stack to perform a String reversal function
- Learnt about the Time Complexity when analysing an algorithm
