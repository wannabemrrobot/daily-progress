### Learnt about the abstract data types

At first, learning about Data Structure concepts doesn't seem to be interesting. But, now I'm getting some traction.

#### Outcomes:
- Learned about Application Runtime,
- And How objects are created at runtime?
- How objects are stored in the memory?
- How Java makes use of the Heap and Stack data structures?
- Garbage Collection
