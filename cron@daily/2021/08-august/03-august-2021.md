### Gotham needs Batman, Your eyes needs Dark Mode
I hate apps that lack dark mode!  
Well, certainly I don't wanna hate my own app :P

Created a configurable theme system for the app.  
`Yes, you can create a theme for this app too.`  
Just add a bunch of CSS variables in a JSON file, and create a PR. Don't forget to name it.

**Sample Theme JSON:** [Hackr Bleed Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wannabemrrobot/daily-progress/main/themes/hackr.json)

### Milestones:
- Surely, the configurable theme system
- Added Tags to better find posts
- Responsive, not the best! but certainly works better
- Minor fixes
- Final release, whoami is in progress
