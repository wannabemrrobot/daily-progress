### Implemented Doubly LinkedList
Vanilla Implementation of Doubly LinkedList, where there are two variables namely `first` and `last` to keep track of the first and last positions in the list. Along with these variables, the Node class have an extra attribute called `previous` along with the `next`, to keep of the previous nodes as well.

#### Note:
- Difficulty in implementing `insertBefore()` method and `displayBackward()` method.
- Messed up with linking the references of the nodes ;)
