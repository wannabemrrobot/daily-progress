### Insertion Sort Implementation
This day can't get harder than this. Confused af! Trickier than the selection sort, BTW (just cause, may be am a noob). Damn, [she](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCxV0kBpA6M) helped me with it. It was great lecture and has to practice little bit dry running the algos.
