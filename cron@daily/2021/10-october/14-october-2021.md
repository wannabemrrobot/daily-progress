### LeetCode - 88 and a miscellaneous Problem
Solved a problem which involves merging a sorted array in Leetcode. My first bruteforce approach was to use a three pointer and an extra array to store the sorted values.
Later, knowing that the optimal solution can be done without an extra array, and traversing from reverse, solving this problem was too easy. 

The second problem includes sorting an array that contains only 2 values, in this case it's 0's and 1's. Did it in 0(n) Time!
