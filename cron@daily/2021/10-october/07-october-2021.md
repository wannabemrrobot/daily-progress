### Algorithms with O(log n)
I knew that Binary search has the `worst time complexity` of `log n`. This time, I've learnt how to calculate the steps taken by the algorithm to arrive at a solution for the given input size.

It was pretty easy. Basic Math :)

#### Insights:
- Binary search is the best known algorithm to search for elements in an array, provided that the array is sorted.
- (log n) algorithms scales well for larger input size.
- Steps/instruction execution calculation for (log n) algorithms.
