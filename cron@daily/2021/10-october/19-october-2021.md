### LeetCode Problem Solving
Well, the solution I came up with, was the optimal approach for [intersection of two arrays problem](https://github.com/wannabemrrobot/becoming-leet/blob/main/leetcode/arrays/350-intersection-of-two-arrays-2/my-solution.java). 
Same, goes for the second problem [ransomnote](https://github.com/wannabemrrobot/becoming-leet/blob/main/leetcode/strings/383-ransomnote/my-solution.java). I came up with O(n) TC. Logic is as same as finding the first unique character in the string. 

#### Insights:
- To convert ArrayList to int[],
  - `int[] intArray = list.stream().mapToInt(i->i).toArray();`
