### Dry ran a matrix problem, which I had in interview
It took some time, to know the problem initially. Then, I devised a shitty approach, that had the worst complexity. But, the problem statement is that to calculate the minimum operations needed to make all the elements in the binary matrix as 1.

#### Insights:
- Should learn to approach a problem in a different angle
- dry running the code using a piece of paper is time consuming, yet it is more efficient and less time consuming than starring at the problem and thinking about the approaches.
