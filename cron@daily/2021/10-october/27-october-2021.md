### ZOHO ASSESSMENT @12.15 PM IST
It was quite a good interview, certainly not based upon my performance, but the behavior of the interviewer ;)  

I thought it will be a Managerial HR round, but it was a technical round(Poor Dumbass me!).  


He asked me 3 problems, considering my skill level in the DSA, it was **FUCKING HARD**!  

He is nice though, calm and attentive throughout my vague explanations of non-workable approaches for a problem.

#### Insights:
- Need to work on approaching a problem.
- Focus on the problem statement, rather than premature optimization.
- Follow Spaced Repetition, to recall your approaches fast.
