### LeetCode Problem Solving
Pretty vague day, solved only one `easy` difficulty problem in leetcode.
Solved the `valid parentheses` problem, but the thing is that I found more interesting solutions for this problem in the discussion section of the leetcode.
Wrapped up the day, with a `Tree Overview` lecture from `Jenny's tutorial`.

#### Insights:
- Valid Parentheses can be solved using an array, which is brilliant.
- Various Tree concepts, which includes `trees are acyclic`.
- Trees are unidirectional.
