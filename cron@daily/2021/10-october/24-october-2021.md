### LeetCode Problem Solving
Well, I had been evading the Pascal's triangle problem for quite sometime, 'cause I can't come up with a solution.
This is actually a `DP(Dynamic Programming)` tagged problem in LeetCode.
One of my friend(you know who you are! -_-) had solved it, and we had a conversation about it, which inturn helped me to derive a solution(Not an optimal one, though). Thanks Dumbass! XD
