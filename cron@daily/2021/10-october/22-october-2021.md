### LeetCode Problem Solving
This problem seemed difficult at first, but when I tried dry running it, I came up with a bruteforce solution. Certainly, not the optimal, but yeah I did it(Without the discussion forum XD).

#### Insights:
- Using two stack implementation of the stack is useful for preventing the `lock` of the queue, in multitasking.
