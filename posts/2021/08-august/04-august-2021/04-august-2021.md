## Overview
Blue is an easy rated Windows machine, which is 1475 days old at the time of writing this walkthrough. Has 4.5 rating in HTB with over 24,000 user and system owns.
 
 > Blue, is a machine that is based on the infamous Eternal Blue vulnerability, which is in the SMB protocol V1. 

Blue is pretty straight forward, when you use tools like `Metasploit`. But that's not our goal. This walkthrough primarily focuses on `exploitation without Metasploit`.

 ## Reconnaissance
#### Nmap Scan
 
As always, lets start by scanning the box with the `swiss army knife for recon` aka `nmap`. Issue the following command:

```
nmap -sV -sC -O -oA nmap-scan 10.10.10.40
```

- -sV flag is for the service version enumeration
- -sC flag is to run default scripts against the target
- -O flag is for the OS discovery. (requires elevated priviledges)
- -oA flag is to save the output in all formats
- nmap-scan - file name to save the output
- 10.10.10.40 - machine IP

The output of the following command will be, 
![nmap-scan01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wannabemrrobot/daily-progress/main/posts/2021/08-august/04-august-2021/nmap-scan01.svg)

From, the nmap results, we can see that the `ports 135, 139, 445` is open. 135 is for the RPC client-server communication, whereas `Port 139 is used by SMB dialects that communicate over NetBIOS`. It's a transport layer protocol designed to use in Windows operating systems over a network. `Port 445 is used by newer versions of SMB (after Windows 2000)` on top of a TCP stack, allowing SMB to communicate over the Internet.

## Enumeration
#### nmap vuln scan
Running the nmap vulnscripts on the target, to find if there is any possible attack vector to gain the foothold.
![nmap-scan01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wannabemrrobot/daily-progress/main/posts/2021/08-august/04-august-2021/nmap-scan02.svg)

From, the scan result it is clear that the SMB running on the machine is vulnerable to `Eternal Blue`.

Quick Googling, gives us a bunch of exploits. I've used this exploit, and you are free to use any.
